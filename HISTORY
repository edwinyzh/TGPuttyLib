TGPuttyLib Release History
---------------------

Build 5 - 21 Dec 2019

This update fixes memory and event handle leaks. The event handle leak in winsftp.c is actually
still in the original PuTTY 0.73. I will try to submit the fix to them. The memory leaks were
in DLL exclusive code (well except for one that doesn't affect us anyway).

---------------------
Build 4 - 3 Dec 2019

This update fixes incorrect random permissions on uploaded files, which could happen when 
files were uploaded from a Delphi stream (like the Delphi component does it, even if you 
use the UploadFile method with a file path). 
The bug itself was in the DLL.

Also includes minor improvements in some of the Pascal source code files.

---------------------
Build 3 - 1 Dec 2019

Added C++ Support, including binding and classes for C++ Builder and Visual C++, as well as 
a native C++ Builder SFTP Client component that does not use any Delphi code. 

No import library is needed for C++.

---------------------

Build 2 - 1 Nov 2019

Adds true Delphi Component in tgputtysftpclient.pas, which is fully Unicode. Assumes UTF-8 Encoding is used.
Adds VCL demo based on the new component.
Fixes procedure tgputty_setverbose declaration.
Fixes some UTF-8 problems in messages from the DLL.
Minor Demo improvements, including Unicode support for local filenames when downloading.

---------------------

Build 1 - 20 Oct 2019

Initial Release. Stable but more features will be added
Known Issue: procedure tgputty_setverbose does not work due to missing cdecl;
